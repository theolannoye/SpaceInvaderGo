# Space Invader

I'm developing a Space Invader game to learn Golang.
I'm using the [pixel library](https://github.com/faiface/pixel/) which is a 2D game library developed in Golang.

Be safe to download pixel and the indicated libraries [in the pixel doc](https://github.com/faiface/pixel/#requirements) to compile my project without errors.

Example (in terminal, with go installed) : 
> go get github.com/faiface/pixel

I'll complete this readme step by step.


**Done :**
 - Display the game window
 - Display our ship
 - Move our ship left and right with keyboard detection

**To do :**
 - Laser shots
 - Invaders 
 - Collision between lasers and invaders
 - Lifes
 - Levels
